<h1>OSGI compatible Factories for Gosen</h1>
<p>
As OSGI can not import the same package from multiple bundles it is not possible
to add the additional Solr ***Factories provided by Gosen in the
<code>org.apache.solr.analysis</code> package. So this provides alternative
factories in the <code>org.apache.solr.analysis.gosen</code> package using the
Osig** prefix in the class name.
</p>
<p> Other than that the implementation provided by this package are the same
as of the <code>org.apache.solr.analysis</code> package in the 
<a herf="http://code.google.com/p/lucene-gosen/source/browse/tags/rel-2.0.2/src/java/org/apache/solr/analysis/">
"rel-2.0.2" tag</a> of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lucene-gosen/">Lucene-Gosen</a>
repository.
